        <p>Ćevapi is a grilled dish of minced meat found traditionally in the countries of southeast Europe (the Balkans). It is considered a national dish of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and is also common in Croatia, Montenegro, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Slovenia. Ćevapi has its origins in the Balkans from before the Ottoman period, and represents a regional speciality similar to the köfte kebab. They are usually served in groups of five to ten pieces on a plate or in a flatbread (lepina or somun), often with chopped onions, sour cream, kajmak (milk cream), ajvar (relish), and salt.</p>
