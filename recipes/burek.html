        <img src="../Burek.jpeg">
        <p>Borek or burek is a filled Anatolian, Balkan, Middle Eastern and Central Asian pie made of a thin flaky dough such as filo with a variety of fillings, such as meat, cheese, spinach or potatoes. Boreks are mainly associated with the areas of the Anatolia, Middle East, Armenia, and also with the former Ottoman Empire, including the Balkans and the Caucasus, Eastern European and Central European countries, Northern Africa and Central Asia. A borek may be prepared in a large pan and cut into portions after baking, or as individual pastries. They are usually baked but some varieties can be fried. Borek is sometimes sprinkled with sesame or nigella seeds, and it can be served hot or cold.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 potato, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough</li>
            <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Brown ground beef in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain fat; stir in allspice, paprika, salt, and pepper. Transfer beef to a large bowl and stir in potato and onion.</li>
            <li>Unroll phyllo pastry and transfer 2 sheets to a work surface; stack sheets. Spoon 1/8th of the ground beef mixture down one long edge of the phyllo pastry. Roll phyllo into a tube, encasing beef. Shape the tube into a coil (snail shape). Place the roll on an ungreased baking sheet; brush with melted butter. Repeat, placing finished rolls up against one another to keep them from unrolling.</li>
            <li>Bake burek in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
