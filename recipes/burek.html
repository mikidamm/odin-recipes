        <p>Borek or burek is a filled Anatolian, Balkan, Middle Eastern and Central Asian pie made of a thin flaky dough such as filo with a variety of fillings, such as meat, cheese, spinach or potatoes. Boreks are mainly associated with the areas of the Anatolia, Middle East, Armenia, and also with the former Ottoman Empire, including the Balkans and the Caucasus, Eastern European and Central European countries, Northern Africa and Central Asia. A borek may be prepared in a large pan and cut into portions after baking, or as individual pastries. They are usually baked but some varieties can be fried. Borek is sometimes sprinkled with sesame or nigella seeds, and it can be served hot or cold.</p>
