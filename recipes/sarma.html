        <img src="../Sarma.jpeg">
        <p>Sarma, commonly marketed as stuffed grape leaves or stuffed cabbage leaves, is a stuffed dish in Southeastern European and Middle Eastern cuisine that comprises fermented leaves—such as cabbage, patencia dock, collard, grapevine, kale or chard leaves—rolled around a filling of grains (such as rice), minced meat, or both. Sarma is part of the broader category of stuffed dishes known as dolma.</p>

            <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground ham</li>
            <li>1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound sauerkraut</li>
            <li>1 cup tomato juice</li>
            <li>water to cover</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place cabbage in the freezer for a few days. The night before making the rolls, take it out to thaw.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the beef, pork, ham, rice, onion, egg, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Mix well. Form meat mixture into oblong balls, using 1/2 cup of the mixture at a time. Then, wrap a cabbage leaf around each ball.</li>
            <li>Spread the sauerkraut in the bottom of a large pot, then layer cabbage rolls on top, placing them seam-side down. Pour tomato juice over rolls, then add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for about 3 hours, adding more water as necessary.</li>
